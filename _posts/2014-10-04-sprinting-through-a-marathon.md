This [Metis](http://thisismetis.com) bootcamp is a little like sprinting the whole duration of a marathon. I have been really slacking on my blogging, but only because I am constantly and consistently learning, nonstop **every single day**. Just to give a quick rundown on what I have learned since my last blog post, about 3 weeks ago:

* Polymorphism
* Self Referential Associations
* Refactoring
* AJAX
* Tower of Hanoi
* Big O notation
* Ember
* TDD
* Single Responsibility Principle

That's just a small sample (*and a randomly populated one*) of the different things that I have been exposed to over the past few weeks thanks to both the awesome curriculum developed by the instructors as well as some extra learning I am doing on the side to help me become extra competitive in the marketplace. Even though we have only been at this for about 6 weeks now, it seems like much longer given we are doing it everyday for 8+ hours.

Another thing that has really been helping me drive home some of the concepts we are learning about refactoring is a book I am reading. [*Clean Code* : A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](http://books.google.com/books/about/Clean_Code.html?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC) by Robert C. Martin. It talks a lot about how you can write better, more maintainable, and more readable code that will make you a vastly more successful developer.

It's getting down to the wire. We are past the half way point (this Friday). I am ready for my career as a developer to get started with a great company (TBD), and even more excited to have my learning continue.
